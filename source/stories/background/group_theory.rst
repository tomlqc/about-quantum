Group Theory
============

- Why Group Theory?

  - a theory fundamental to Physics in general
  
  - the basis for :ref:`stories/complements/stabilizer:Stabilizer Codes`
  
  - a central element to understand 
    :ref:`stories/complements/topological:Topological Quantum Computer`

- :draft:`My ongoing learning path:`

  - *Group Theory and Its Application to Physical Problems* :cite:`Hamermesh2012`

  - a nice illustration of the
    `representation of the symmetric group S3 <https://groupprops.subwiki.org/wiki/Linear_representation_theory_of_symmetric_group:S3>`_
    in :cite:`GroupProps`
