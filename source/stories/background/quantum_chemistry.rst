    To reach the second quantized formulation, one typically
    first approximates the nuclei as fixed classical point
    charges under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and
    chooses a basis Ï†i in which to represent the electronic wave
    function. Often, one chooses a basis of N molecular
    orbitals, constructed as a linear combination of atomic
    orbitals (LCAO), which are computed using a mean-field
    procedure known in chemistry as the Hartree-Fock (HF)
    method [71]. The atomic orbital basis functions are derived
    from variations of hydrogenlike atomic orbitals for differ-
    ent values of Z. They are numerically optimized to match
    desired physical properties across a range of systems
    and to be compatible with systematic improvement [72].
    Usually, the basis functions are expressed as sums of
    Gaussian functions rather than the original Slater-type
    orbitals to enhance the efficiency of integral evaluation.
    This choice is convenient for small problems but not
    mandatory, and much work has been done recently to
    improve the Hamiltonian representation for electronic
    structure problems [40,41].
