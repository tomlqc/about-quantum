Young Double-Slit Experiment
============================

The double-slit experiment is fundamental to illustrate **wave-particle duality**
as well as **superposition of quantum states**.

A **fantastic explanation** was given **by Richard Feynman** in his
`Lecture about Quantum Behaviour <https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/III_01.html>`_ :cite:`Feynman2013`,
that I strongly encourage you to read.

See also which-path experiments in :cite:`Haroche2013`, section 6.1.
