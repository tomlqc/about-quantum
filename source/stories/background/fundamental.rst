Superposition
-------------

The state of a quantum system is described by a vector in an abstract space:
a Hilbert space, that may be of finite or infinite dimension.
A way to describe a measurement is to associate it to one particular basis of this space,
e.g. :math:`\{ \ket{\psi_1}, \dots, \ket{\psi_n} \}`,
such that the different outcomes of the measurement correspond to the projection
onto one of the elements of the basis.

The relation between a measurement and the concept of superposition
is that any state vector can be expressed in the measurement's basis,
and that this expression is basically a weighted sum of the basis' vectors:
e.g. :math:`\ket{\psi} = c_1 \ket{\psi_1} + \dots + c_n \ket{\psi_n}`.
This sum is a superposition of the states :math:`\psi_\alpha`.

Thus the state of a quantum system can be expressed in an infinite number of different superpositions,
each of it associated to a basis of the Hilbert space.
