  "Diamond qubits are created through the quantum entanglement of quasi-free electrons in nitrogen-vacancy centers (“NV centers”) of the diamond crystal lattice. However, current methods for the fabrication of such NV centers do not allow an upscaling of diamond-based qubits to sufficiently large assemblies of multiple qubits in the form of arrays, which are needed for quantum computing. So far, there is a lack of methods that allow a defined placement of nitrogen atoms in the crystal lattice. This, however, is necessary for the coupling of multiple NV centers to create larger arrays."
