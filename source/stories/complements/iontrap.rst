Trapped Ions
============

Ions can be trapped by electromagnetic forces, either in an oscillating quadripole electric field [#Paul]_ or
in a combination of an electric and a magnetic field.
While the ions have different internal states, they are also subject to vibrational modes.
Two **internal states** can be selected to from a qubit, while the **vibrational modes** can be used
as a mediator for the interaction between the ions.
By properly choosing the frequency and length of **laser pulses**, the ions can be entangled, and
circuit gates can be implemented. See also the section
:ref:`entanglement in ion traps <stories/complements/entanglement:Ion traps>`.

           The trajectories of ions in a Paul trap describe Lissajous curves.
