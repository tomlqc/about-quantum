**Ions** can be **trapped by electromagnetic forces**,
either in an oscillating quadripole electric field [#Paul]_ or
in a combination of an electric and a magnetic field.
While the ions have different internal states, they are also subject to vibrational modes.
Two **internal states** can be selected to from a qubit, while the **vibrational modes** can be used
as a mediator for the interaction between the ions.
By properly choosing the frequency and length of **laser pulses**, the ions can be entangled, and
circuit gates can be implemented. See also the section
:ref:`entanglement of trapped ions <stories/complements/entanglement:Trapped Ions>`.

.. [#Paul] The principle of the Paul trap is nicely illustrated by this

           The trajectories of ions in a Paul trap describe Lissajous curves.
