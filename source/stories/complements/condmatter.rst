Condensed-Matter Physics
========================

Fundamental and challenging problems in condensed-matter physics can be
investigated with quantum simulators. 
Because it is a very specialized and technical topic,
and I have no in-depth knowledge of the field,
I simply refer to three review papers about the topic,
and provide a basic list of selected applications.

.. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

> *Quantum simulation* :cite:`Georgescu_2014`

- Hubbard model (the simplest model of interacting  particles  on  a  lattice)
- Spin models
- Quantum phase transitions
- Disordered and frustrated systems
- Superconductivity

Examples:

- "quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a Mott insulator using a cold atomic gas in an optical lattice"
- "simulation of an antiferro-magnetically coupled spin chain in an external magnetic field"
- "simulation of artificial gauge fields"
- "the high-temperature superconductivity of compounds containing copper-oxide planes
  is still a puzzlethat might be solved using large-scale simulations."

> *Ultracold atomic gases in optical lattices: mimicking condensed matter physics and beyond* :cite:`Lewenstein_2007`

- "provide an efficient way to calculate ground state properties and dynamical evolution
  of many condensed matter system"
- "superfluid – Mott insulator (SF–MI) quantum phase transition"
- "ultracold disordered Bose-Fermi mixtures in optical lattices may serve as a paradigm fermionic system
  to study a variety of disordered phases and phenomena: from Fermi glass to quantum glass
  and quantum percolation"
- "frustrated models: antiferromagnetic models" [#frust]_
- etc.

> *Quantum simulations with ultracold quantum gases* :cite:`Bloch_2012`

- quantum simulation of ultracold Fermi gases with attractive interactions:
  e.g. BEC–BCS crossover [#BEC-BCS]_
- In a typical condensed-matter system, electrons can be modelled as moving on a lattice
  generated by the periodic array of atom cores.
  Such a general setting can be simulated with ultracold atoms using the concept of an "optical lattice".
- Artificial gauge fields: Can one use atomic gases to simulate charged quantum many-body systems,
  such as an electron fluid in an external magnetic field?

And additional topics for research from I. Bloch's guest lecture :cite:`LMUQH2021`:

* *Motion of a single hole in a quantum antiferromagnet* :cite:`Kane_1989`:
  an elementary, simple problem definition by three renown physicists.

* *High-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides* :cite:`Keimer_2015`.

See also:

* | *Quantum simulations of materials on near-term quantum computers* :cite:`Ma_2020`:
  | "ground and excited state properties of several spin-defects in solids including the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, the neutral silicon-vacancy (SiV) center in diamond, and the Cr impurity (4+) in 4H-SiC

.. [#frust]
    
    "
    Frustration appears when all the constraints imposed by the Hamiltonian cannot be
    simultaneously fullfilled and it is an inherent property of some strongly correlated systems.
    "
    :cite:`Lewenstein_2007`.
    
.. [#BEC-BCS]
    
    "
    Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) superfluidity originates from the weak pairing of particles
    into Cooper pairs, which are made of two particles of opposite spin and velocity. [...]
    In the other limit of interaction strength [...] as these molecules are made of two fermions,
    they behave as bosonic particles and form a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) at low temperature.
    "
    :cite:`Bloch_2012`.
