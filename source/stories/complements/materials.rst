:draft:`How quantum computers could be used to improve "classical" materials,
by increasing the accuracy over simulations on classical computers
while allowing to simulate more complex systems.`

**Cascade of simulation methods by increasing accuracy**:
classical {Hartree-Fock -> DFT -> DMRG (density matrix renorm. group)} ->
quantum {qubit Hamiltonian (from DMRG orbitals)}
