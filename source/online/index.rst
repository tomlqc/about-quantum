About Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing:

- `Quantum Country <https://quantum.country/>`_
  by Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen

  An online book with a novel approach, intended to facilitate understanding and memorizing.
  It describes "the basic principles of quantum computing and quantum mechanics,
  plus two important applications: the quantum search algorithm and quantum teleportation."
  
  Michael Nielsen is, together with Isaac Chuang, the author of
  *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* :cite:`Nielsen2010`,
  one of the `most cited books <https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/1972505>`_
  in physics of all time.

- `An Introduction to Quantum Computing
  <https://www.quantum-inspire.com/kbase/introduction-to-quantum-computing>`_
  by `QuTech <https://qutech.nl>`_
  
  An overview with videos from the `QuTech Academy <https://qutechacademy.nl/>`_.
  The QuTech Academy also offers online courses on `edX <https://www.edx.org/school/delftx>`_
  about hardware, architecture and algorithms.
  
  QuTech was `founded in 2014 <https://qutech.nl/about-us/our-organisation/>`_
  as a collaboration between Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)
  and the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO).

- `Quantum Computing Documentation <https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/docs/>`_ by IBM
  
  Very broad offer with many lectures and manuals. I recommend:
  
  * `Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Hardware <https://qiskit.org/learn/intro-qc-qh/>`_ -
    A series of quite technical lectures with videos, notes and programming exercises.
  
  * `Qiskit Textbook <https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html>`_ -
    Qiskit manual that also covers physical models and quantum algorithms.

- `QuTiP User Guide <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/guide.html>`_ - an academic software package

  Although just a manual to QuTiP, contents many details about physical models
  (e.g. `Bloch-Redfield master eq.
  <http://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/dynamics/dynamics-bloch-redfield.html>`_)

Computing
---------

A selection of software and platforms for quantum computing:

- `IBM Quantum <https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/>`_ -
  Open-source SDK (`Qiskit`, *Quantum Composer*, *Quantum Lab*),
  for running on IBM's computers or simulators.

- `Google Quantum AI <https://quantumai.google/>`_ -
  *Cirq* Python library and Quantum Computing Services on simulators or on *Sycamore* & co.

- `Rigetti Forest <https://github.com/rigetti/forest-software>`_ -
  Rigetti's software for its own quantum computers.

- `Microsoft Q# & Azure Quantum <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/development-kit>`_ -
  Microsoft's SDK, for running on the Microsoft Quantum Network of hardware and simulators.
  
- `Amazon Braket <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/braket/>`_ -
  Run quantum algorithms on Rigetti or D-Wave hardware or on a AWS simulator.

- `QuTech QuantumInspire <https://www.quantum-inspire.com/>`_ -
  Run quantum algorithms on simulators or hardware backends.
  Graphical interface to program in QASM (Quantum Assembly Language).

Python Packages
-----------------

Python packages that I have played with:

- `Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/>`_ -
  "Qiskit is an open source SDK for working with quantum computers
  at the level of pulses, circuits and application modules."
- `QuTiP <http://qutip.org/>`_ -
  "Quantum Toolbox in Python, QuTiP is open-source software for simulating
  the dynamics of open quantum systems."

Python packages that I am planning to play with:

- `Cirq <https://quantumai.google/cirq>`_ - 
  "Cirq is a Python software library for writing, manipulating, and optimizing quantum circuits,
  and then running them on quantum computers and quantum simulators. "

- `pyGSTi <https://www.pygsti.info/>`_ -
  "Gate Set Tomography, pyGSTi is an open-source software for modeling and characterizing
  noisy quantum information processors (QIPs), i.e., systems of one or more qubits."
