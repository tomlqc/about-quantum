Computing Models
================

- | Universal quantum computer:

  - The quantum-circuit or :ref:`intro/computing/gates:Gate Model`
    will be described in the next chapters.
    
  - A variant is the *measurement-based model* playing a main role in the
    :ref:`Photonics Quantum Computer Realization <stories/complements/photonics:Photonics>`. 

- | Adiabatic quantum computer:
  
  - The major algorithm run on an adiabatic quantum computer is called **Quantum Annealing**.
  - This computing model has not of universal purpose,
    but can be used to solved combinatorial optimization problems.
  - see the chapter devoted to :ref:`stories/complements/adiabatic:Adiabatic Quantum Computer`.

- | Topological quantum computer:

  - a not-so-easy-to-grasp approach based on quantum systems living in a 2-dimensional physical space,
    that would inherently possess a great stability and resistance to noise,
  - still not (or at least not conclusively) experimentally verified,
  - see the chapter devoted to :ref:`stories/complements/topological:Topological Quantum Computer`.
