Computing Models
================

- | Quantum circuit or gate-based model: see :ref:`intro/computing/gates:Gate Model`.

- | Adiabatic quantum computer (*alias* Quantum Annealing):
  
  - review: *Adiabatic Quantum Computation* :cite:`Albash_2018`
  - *Readiness* :cite:`PerdomoOrtiz_2019`
  - applications: SAT-Problem :cite:`Fahri_2000`, Quantum Chemistry :cite:`Kassal_2011`

- | Topological quantum computer:

  - a not-so-easy-to-grasp approach based on quantum systems living in a 2-dimensional physical space,
    that would inherently possess a great stability and resistance to noise,
  - still not (or at least not conclusively) experimentally verified,
  - see :ref:`stories/complements/topological:Topological Quantum Computer`.
