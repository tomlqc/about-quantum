Superconducting Circuits
========================

- "anharmonic oscillators (AHOs) constructed from superconducting circuit element"
- review paper: engineer's guide :cite:`Krantz_2019`, state of play :cite:`Kjaergaard_2020`
- implemented by Google, IBM, Rigetti
- more (?): :cite:`Gambetta_2017`


- coupling resonators (CR) for implementing two-qubit gates,
  see also :math:`U_{ENT}` (entangle) in :cite:`Kandala_2017`
- insights about the pulse model in IBM's hardware :cite:`Asfaw_2019`:
  "Finding Resonance", "Rabi Oscillations: Hello Quantum at the Pulse level", "Quantifying the Environment: Computing T1 and T2"
