*How to characterize the capability of the hardware?*

- One *ansatz* is the **Quantum Volume** :cite:`Cross_2019`:

    | "Quantum Volume = :math:`2^n`
    | where N is the (width=depth) of the largest random square circuit
      that can be successfully run on a quantum computing system."

*To investigate:*

- | *Superconductor–semiconductor hybrid-circuit quantum electrodynamics* :cite:`Burkard_2020`:
  | "hybrid ‘super–semi’ quantum systems, which coherently couple superconducting cavities to semiconductor quantum dots"
