Entanglement
============

Draft:

- Composite systems i.e. quantum systems made of several particles,
  can also be in a superposition of states, like single particles do.
- | The strange fact is that we can achieve states were the several particles are strongly correlated:
  | i.e. if particle *a* is measured in state :math:`\ket{a_1}`,
    then particle *b* will always be measured in :math:`\ket{b_1}`.
  | e.g. the entangled state
    :math:`\ket{\psi} = \ket{a_1} \ket{b_1} + \ket{a_2} \ket{b_2}`.
- | Quantum concept of measurement can be interpreted as a collapse of the state
    (Copenhagen interpretation): one of the terms in the superposition will be randomly "choosen".
  | This leads to a paradox in the sense that for separated entangled particles,
    this "choice" will be done at the same time at arbitrary far locations!
