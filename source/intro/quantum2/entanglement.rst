**Composite systems** i.e. quantum systems that are made of several particles,
can also be in a superposition of states, like single particles do.

The strange fact is that we can achieve states were the several particles are **strongly correlated**:

    We know that in this case
    if particle *a* is measured in state :math:`\ket{a_1}`,
    then particle *b* will always be measured in :math:`\ket{b_1}`.
    This entangled state would be described by this formula

.. math::
    \ket{\psi} = \ket{a_1} \ket{b_1} + \ket{a_2} \ket{b_2}

The result of the measurement of *a* cannot be known *a priori*,
but the result of the measurement of *b* will be certain.
This property is called **entanglement**,
and occurs when the wave function cannot be written as a product state in terms of the states
of the individual particles.

The concept of **measurement** in quantum mechanics can be interpreted as a **collapse** of the state
(*Copenhagen interpretation*): one of the terms in the superposition will be randomly "choosen".
This leads to a paradox in the sense that for separated entangled particles,
this "choice" will be done at the same time at arbitrary far locations!
Einstein called this the "spooky action at a distance".

How the correlation occurs in more complex settings cannot be explained by classical physics and statistics.
A thorough and definitive experimental proof of the validity of the rules of quantum mechanics 
wrt. entanglement was achieved
with the so-called :ref:`stories/background/EPR_experiments:EPR experiments`
based on the :ref:`stories/complements/bell:Bell Inequalities`.

A few examples of realization of entanglement are listed in the :ref:`physical implementation <stories/complements/entanglement:Entanglement>` section: This is real!
