Draft:

- Haroche calls them "Spins and springs": the qubits and the mediating entities between them.

- :ref:`stories/background/harmonic:Harmonic Oscillator`: springs
- :ref:`stories/background/twolevel:Two-Level Systems`: spins

- | :ref:`stories/background/2ndquant:Second Quantization`:
  | Example: Not only the energy levels of the atoms are quantized.
    but also the electromagnetic field itself!
    The quantization of light nicely fits in the framework of the Harmonic Oscillator.
  | By considering both quantization together,
    we can formulate the Hamiltonians that describe the quantum system's dynamics.

- | :ref:`stories/background/environment:Environment`:
  | There is a sound framework for describing the action of the environment on a quantum system.
    It is well modelled, and a mandatory tool to describe the noise in a Quantum Computer.
