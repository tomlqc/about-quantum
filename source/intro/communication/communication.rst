:draft:`Draft - includes Quantum Cryptography.`

- | Teleportation:
  | of a state, not of a particle !

- | Repeaters:
  | about how to preserve coherence over large distances by "transfering" entanglement from one particle to another

- | Cryptography:
  | quantum cryptography, as an alternative to current public-key cryptosystems,
  | but it isn't neither absolutely failsafe, as errors due to decoherence cannot be completely avoided,
    and this can be exploited by dissimulating the interception of messages,
    leading in return to techniques about how to check the integrity of messages.
