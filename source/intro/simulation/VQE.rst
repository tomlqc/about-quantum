Variational Quantum Eigensolver
===============================

- Lecture 19 :cite:`LMUQH2021`:, *VQE for small molecules* :cite:`Kandala_2017`

  - VQE compute energy with quantum computer, optimize parameters classically
  - makes sense if "computation of energy of trial state cannot be done efficiently with a classical computer",
  - need to map the electronic structure of the molecule (fermionic problem, atomic orbitals)
    to the gate-based quantum (single and two-qubits gates)

- "a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation of two intermediate-scale chemistry problems:
  the binding energy of hydrogen chains (as large as H12) and the isomerization mechanism of diazene"
  :cite:`Arute_2020`
