My personal experience about how to learn from quantum mechanics up to quantum computing.

I started with:

- *Quantum Mechanics* by Basdevant & Dalibard :cite:`Basdevant2005`.

Then I delved into:

- *Exploring the Quantum* by Haroche & Raimond :cite:`Haroche2013`.
- *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen & Chuang :cite:`Nielsen2010`.

These three books pretty well prepared me to **two lectures** of the
`Master's program <https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/msc/qst/qst/>`_
in **Quantum Science and Technology**,
offered by Technical University of Munich and Ludwig-Maximilians-University,
that I attended [#fguest]_ in Winter 2020/2021:

- *Quantum Hardware* by Prof. M. Aidelsburger of LMU :cite:`LMUQH2021`
- *Quantum Information* by Prof. I. Cirac of TUM :cite:`TUMQI2021`

This set the basis for understanding more advanced articles,
as the ones listed in :ref:`biblio/index:Review Papers` and :ref:`biblio/index:Articles`.
I recommend especially:

- *A quantum engineerâ€™s guide to superconducting qubits* by Krantz *et al.* :cite:`Krantz_2019`
- *Quantum simulation* by I. Georgesco *et al.* :cite:`Georgescu_2014`

.. [#fguest] I was allowed to attend the lectures,
    but I wasn't enrolled in the Master's degree program.
