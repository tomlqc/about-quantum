I started with:

- *Quantum Mechanics* by Basdevant & Dalibard :cite:`Basdevant2005`.

Then I delved into:

- *Exploring the Quantum* by Haroche & Raimond :cite:`Haroche2013`.
- *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen & Chuang :cite:`Nielsen2010`.

These three books pretty well prepared me to two lectures of the
`Master's program <https://www.ph.tum.de/academics/msc/qst/qst/>`_
in **Quantum Science and Technology**,
offered by Technical University of Munich and Ludwig-Maximilians-University,
that I attended as a guest student [#fguest]_ in Winter 2020/2021:

- *Quantum Hardware* by Prof. M. Aidelsburger of LMU :cite:`LMUQH2021`
- *Quantum Information* by Prof. I. Cirac of TUM :cite:`TUMQI2021`


.. rubric:: Notes

.. [#fguest] I was allowed to attend the lectures,
    but I wasn't enrolled in the Master's degree program.
