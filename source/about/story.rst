The story behind the story
--------------------------

In January 2020, I started refreshing my Quantum Mechanics,
and by the mid of the year I was able to dive into more complex topics of Quantum Science,
see the :ref:`about/syllabus:Syllabus`.

I had precise goals in mind from the beginning.

.. rubric:: The goals for my self-studies

- Have an idea of the experimental setup used in the various approaches to quantum computers and about their underlying physics.
- Understand the principles of quantum computing.
- Learn about quantum algorithms and about the problems that can be solved more efficiently than with classical computers.
- Know the current state of the art, and be able to read research papers.

.. rubric:: Why writing?

I have spent really a lot of time learning, in parallel to a full-time job and
to my father-of-five [#fof6]_ duties. And because I did all this without the
perspective of getting a degree, I wanted to make my efforts visible,
and to find a way to conclude these self-studies.

.. rubric:: What to write?

There are several textbooks that already present and explain the physics I am talking about.
And the topics that are not yet in textbooks, are described in articles 
published in peer-reviewed journals, many of them freely accessible.
So it would be senseless to try explaining again these physics in details,
when experts already explained much better than I could.

But what I was missing was an overview of Quantum 2.0 that was between
simple introductory slide shows or 20 minute lecture series on one side, and
graduate level courses on the other.

Also there are some special topics that I wanted to deepen, that in my impression,
were to quickly addressed in textbooks or published articles,
or where I wanted to provide some illustration.

.. rubric:: The goals for this blog?

- Provide an intermediate level introduction to quantum science.
- Expose some special topics from my personal point of view -
  the one of a nonphysicist - for illustration purposes.
- Offer a path to people with a similar background, 
  who want to learn about Quantum Science.

Finally two principle shall guide me:

- Explain *why* rather than *what*.
- Illustrate.
