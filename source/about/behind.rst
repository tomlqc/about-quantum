Behind the scenes
=================

.. rubric:: Sphinx

To write this *blog*, I searched for a platform that allows to easily:

* write mathematical equations, preferably in *LaTeX* syntax ;
* manage a bibliography ;
* insert links to internal or external references ;
* present pieces of code and their output, also graphical elements (figures) ;
* edit the contents on my local computer, without depending on a web app ;
* use a versioning system.

Additionally I wanted the page to render nicely on large screens
as well as on mobile devices.

This is why I chose `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_,
that was initially designed for documenting *python* code,
and has everything I was looking for.

| That's why it looks like I am building a *Quantum Science Manual*!
