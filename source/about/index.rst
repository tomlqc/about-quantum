The story behind the stories
----------------------------

Quantum Science from the perspective of a non-physicist.

I started with:

- *Quantum Mechanics* by Basdevant & Dalibard :cite:`Basdevant2005`.

Then I delved into:

- *Exploring the Quantum* by Haroche & Raimond :cite:`Haroche2013`.
- *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information* by Nielsen & Chuang :cite:`Nielsen2010`.

These three books pretty well prepared me to two lectures of the master's degree in **Quantum Science and Technology**, offered by Technical University of Munich and Ludwig-Maximilians-University, that I attended as a guest student in Winter 2020/2021:

- *Quantum Hardware* by Prof. M. Aidelsburger of LMU :cite:`LMUQH2021`
- *Quantum Information* by Prof. I. Cirac of TUM :cite:`TUMQI2021`
